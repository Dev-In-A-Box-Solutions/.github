## Our Products

### GPT Powertoys
GPT Powertoys is an essential toolset for users of OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 models. It extends the functionality of these models with various quality of life and productivity enhancements. Some of the key features include:

- **API Connectivity:** Connect directly to OpenAI's GPT Models via their API (a valid account is required). Alternatively, you can connect to Microsoft Azure's OpenAI resource, assuming you have access to a valid deployment.
- **Secure Conversation Sharing:** Share encrypted conversations with friends or colleagues. All data is locally stored for your convenience and can be accessed offline or online.
- **Accessibility Features:** We are committed to making AI more accessible to everyone. GPT Powertoys provides options for users with visual impairments or dyslexia, with ongoing improvements in future updates.

We're extending the functionality of this product to also include other LLM providers in the future as well as the addition of being able to utilise image generation models within the application.

### TokenEvaluator.Net

It uses AI provider's 'tiktoken' file for this purpose. This tool is essential for developers and users who need to manage and optimize their usage of AI services.
